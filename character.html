<br>
            <h2 class="text-left">Your guild and world</h2>
            <br>
            <p class="text-left">You are part of a small collection of inexperienced <c>Planars</c>, shareholders running a starting business on a relatively newly added world. The players are encouraged to cooperate in creating both their guild and the world before the actual game begins. Anything is possible, from banking, to adamantine prospecting, to mercenary company, on an ocean planet, jungle moon, or fiery world. The only rule is that no player may invalidate what another player has put forward. In short, the rule is called “Yes, and…”. Keep in mind that you will be playing with whatever you create, so any tomfoolery will reflect back on you. Shares in the company are represented by <c>Tass</c>, <c>Tass</c> being measured in chests. Each character brings 3 <c>Tass</c> to the table.</p>


<br>
            <h2 class="text-left">Occupations and Core Mechanic</h2>
            <br>
            <p class="text-left">Each character is defined by <c>Occupations</c>. If you can justify how an <c>Occupation</c> is relevant for the situation your character is in, you can use it. Each <c>Occupation</c> has a bonus value (1-10) called <c>Rank</c>. Rolling is simple. You roll a ten sided die, add bonuses and penalties, then compare it to a <c>Target Number</c>. If the <c>Total Result</c> is equal or higher, the character succeeds at his action. In short:</p>
            <br>
            <p class="text-center"><c>1d10 + Occupation Rank + Modifiers VS Target Number</c></p>
            <br>
            <p class="text-left">When rolling a 1 or a 10, the die is rerolled, and the new result is kept. On a double 10, a character has performed a <c>Critical Success</c> (i.e. producing not only a painting, but the next Mona Lisa). On a double 1, a <c>Character</c> has a <c>Critical Failure</c> (the gun not only misses, but hits an ally).</p>
            <br>
            <p class="text-left">A character begins with three <c>Occupations</c>: <c>Background</c>, <c>Profession</c>, and <c>Hobby</c>. These must be specific, e.g. if a character has a soldier <c>Profession</c> he must decide if he’s a Rifleman, Paratrooper, Navy Seal etc. It helps if they are defined as occupations and not skills, as they offer a wider usage. For example a charracter who has <c>Hobby</c> Architect might know a bit of the language of the workers on his construction site. Someone who only has <c>Hobby</c> Architecture will probably not.</p>
            <br>
            <p>After choosing his initial Occupations</c>, the player must assign <c>Ranks</c> to each <c>Occupation</c> (starting set is +3,+2,+1 in any order preferred). <c>Ranks</c> specify exactly how good a character is on those associated <c>Occupations</c>. Note that <c>Occupations</c> don't stack, so if you have Military Sniper +2 as <c>Background</c> and Hunter +1 as <c>Hobby</c> your character will only be as good with a sniper rifle as his highest <c>Occupation</c>.</p>            
<br>
            <h2 class="text-left">Sleeve</h2>
            <br>
            <p class="text-left">With powerful arcane arts come powerful conjuration and transmutation. Custom bodies become available, and some creatures are even grown and harvested for the particular reason of being inhabited by <c>Planars</c>. These custom bodies are known as <c>Sleeves</c>, and a <c>Planar</c> controls them through an amulet called a <c>Phylactery</c>, which stores an instance of the <c>Planar’s</c> mind. The <c>Phylactery</c> is somewhere on or inside the <c>Slevee</c>. A wide range of shapes, types, and sizes are available for <c>Sleeves</c>, from organics to mechanical. </p>
            <br>
            <p class="text-left">Numerous guilds out there provide <c>Sleeves</c> for usage. A fresh new <c>Sleeve</c> comes with three important <c>Traits</c>: <c>Life</c>, <c>Will</c>, and <c>Mana</c>. These have a <c>Maximum</c> and an expendable <c>Pool</c> which will vary. A starting character begins with 9 <c>Points</c> to distribute as he wishes (e.g. <c>Life</c> 4/4 <c>Will</c> 2/2 <c>Mana</c> 3/3). The <c>Pool</c> will naturally go down during the game, but can also be spent for various bonuses, all based on your character's <c>Occupations</c>(e.g. a pyrokinetic can summon a fire elemental follower). Unless otherwise noted, only one <c>Point</c> can be spent per action. Keep in mind, however, that if any of these <c>Pools</c> is reduced below zero, the <c>Sleeve</c> is exhausted or destroyed, and the <c>Planar</c> must find a new one.</p>
            <br>            
            <p class="text-left"><c>Life</c> represent not only a <c>Sleeves'</c> vitality, but also defensive and restorative capabilities (e.g. armor, regeneration, potions, magic shields etc.).</p> 
            <ul>
            <li><p><c>Life</c> <c>Points</c> can be expended to conjure a temporary Follower of modest <c>Occupation</c> (equal to the number of spent <c>Points</c>).</p></li>
            <li>Spent to roll again. This can only be done once, on your action, not as a reaction.</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <p class="text-left"><c>Will</c> represent a <c>Sleeves'</c> willpower, stamina, and stress resistance. While a mages’ mind can be particularly strong willed, a <c>Sleeves'</c> physical nerves can only take so much.</p> 
            <ul>
              <li><p>Can be spent to enhance a spell effect(affecting more targets, a wider area etc.)</p></li>
              <li><p><c>Will</c> <c>Points</c> can be used to gain a +1 to a single roll.</p></li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <p class="text-left"><c>Mana</c> represent a <c>Sleeves'</c> reserves for magic and equipment. Rather than flat out giving bonuses, purchased equipment usually allows a character to attempt a different sort of action (e.g. wand of levitation).</p> 
            <ul>
              <li><p>Passable to another player, in whatever form the <c>Planar</c> wishes(<c>Life</c>, <c>Will</c>, <c>Mana</c>).<p></li>
              <li><p>Need some equipment, but forgot to bring it with you? Simply conjure it out in the field by expend <c>Mana</c> <c>Points</c>. Costs may vary, and are usually more expensive than purchasing something with <c>Tass</c> from the market.</p></li>
            </ul>
            
            <br>
            <p class="text-left">In addition, a <c>Sleeve</c> has an three <c>Advantages</c>. These are usually specialized e.g. heavy lifter, multiple arms, acid spitter.</p>



<br>
            <h2 class="text-left">Obtaining a new Sleeve</h2>
            <br>
            <p class="text-left">If a <c>Sleeve</c> is destroyed, there is no actual damage to the soul of the <c>Planar</c> inhabiting it, as long as the phylactery is intact. In fact, the phylactery can be hooked up and merged back with the backup, still available somewhere on a <c>Shardscape</c> server. Whatever form the phylactery takes, it is usually difficult to destroy. If it is destroyed, however, the <c>Planar</c> will not remember anything that happened after the phylactery was attached to the <c>Sleeve</c>. In game terms, this might translate in not gaining as much <c>XP</c> for a particular gaming session.</p>
            <br>
            <p class="text-left">A new standard <c>Sleeve</c> (9 <c>Points</c> of <c>Traits</c>) costs 1 <c>Tass</c>. For every <c>Trait Maximum</c> and <c>Advantage</c> added, the cost rises by 1 <c>Tass</c>. If a <c>Planar</c> does not have the <c>Tass</c> even for a basic <c>Sleeve</c> or access to a guild which can provide one, there are other ways of obtaining a <c>Sleeve</c>. This usually involves the help of an ally who will find a host (willing but more commonly unwilling) and implant the phylactery in it. Note, however, that these hosts are usually inferior(less than 9 <c>Traits</c>).</p>

<br>
            <h2 class="text-left">Goals and XP</h2>
            <br>
            <p class="text-left"><c>Goals</c> are a character’s personal agenda. They must be specific and achievable (e.g. build an accounting start-up which survives a fiscal year, not get rich). Up to three <c>Goals</c> may be active at any time. <c>Goals</c> are broken up in the actions needed to reach it, and each is a <c>Checkbox</c>. The default number of <c>Checkboxes</c> is 3, though this may vary. When doing something towards fulfilling his <c>Goals</c>, the player should notify the GM. If the GM agrees, he decides how many <c>Checkboxes</c> are ticked since some actions may be more fruitful (e.g. finding a clue about the man who murdered your family nets 1 <c>Checkbox</c>, but killing him might end the <c>Goal</c>). Once a <c>Goal</c> is completed, the character decides on a new one.</p>
            <br>
            <p class="text-left">When the character completes a <c>Goal</c>, she gets a choice of rewards from the following:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>3 <c>Points</c> to replenish any <c>Trait Pool</c>
                <li>1 <c>Tass</c></li>
                <li>1 <c>XP</c></li>
            </ul>




            <br>
            <h2 class="text-left">Progressing</h2>
            <br>
            <p class="text-left">Acquiring a new <c>Occupation Rank</c> costs 3 x <c>Desired Rank</c> in <c>XP</c>.(e.g. 15 <c>XP</c> for a +5). Intermediates must also be acquired (e.g. from <c>Rank</c> 1 to <c>Rank</c> 3 costs 18 XP)</p>

            <h2 class="text-left">Three to One Rule and Target Numbers</h2>
            <br>
            <p class="text-left">At times, your success will depend on how much your <c>Total</c> <c>Result</c> is. For example, when aiding another with an activity, your ally's <c>Total</c> <c>Result</c> increases by 1 for every 3 in your <c>Total</c> <c>Result</c>. This sort of rule is known as <c>Three to One</c>, and can have various forms for various effects e.g. <c>Five to One</c>, <c>One to One</c>.</p>

            <p class="text-left">As a basic rule, on a successful <c>Result</c> your attacks can harm 1 target for 1 <c>Life</c>. Naturally, this will kill most mortals in one blow, but not all. Various types of equipment and defenses can have various interactions, which will not be detailed, and hopefully be common sense (i.e. punching versus hitting somebody with a sword).</p>
            <br>
            <p class="text-left">Although magic and common sense don’t exactly mix, keep in mind that while magic is indeed powerful, a body is just as vulnerable to an arrow as it is an acid blast. The context is what matters: who the target is (a fire hound is more vulnerable to an icebolt than an ice djinn), what protection it is using (someone in plate armor won’t care much for flying knives), and environment (no point in casting a fireball underwater).</p>
            <br>
            <p><c>Planars</c>, usually being experienced in the arts of warfare, have various automatic defenses that spring up when they get attacked. In terms of mechanics, each <c>Planar</c> has an <c>Defense</c> of 5 + relevant <c>Occupation Rank</c>. What form this takes is up to the player.
