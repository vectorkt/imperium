            <br>            
            <h2 class="text-left">The Planes</h2>
            <br>
            <p class="text-left">Scholars speculate that the multiverse is composed of an infinity of planes. A plane is a world or collection of worlds unified by shared laws of physics, magic, and sometimes morals. Planes are usually immense and infinite; those defined by finite borders are classified as demiplanes. Knowledgeable planewalkers divide the planes into three large categories, sometimes depicted as rings, though this may vary.</p>
            <br>
            <p class="text-left"> The first is <c>Prime Material Planes</c>, a collection of planes with worlds very much like our own: regular gravity, magic, and populations that vary by level of development. The second category is the <c>Inner Planes</c>, also known as the <c>Elemental Planes</c>, as each is governed by a single one: Fire, Water etc. Lastly, there are the <c>Outer Planes</c>, where concepts, morals and beliefs take physical forms.</p>
            <br>
            <p class="text-left">This embedded ring structure is connected by natural portals, whose continued existence is still being studied. Powerful creatures within the multiverse also create and maintain artificial gates, for various purposes. The interconnectedness of the planes naturally leads to transitive areas, such as the Paraelemental Plane of Ice between the Air and Water <c>Elemental Planes</c>, or the Astral Plane, connecting the <c>Prime Materials</c> with the <c>Outer Planes</c>. Planeshifter academics, however, are at a loss as to how to classify these, as they share virtually no traits outside their transitivity. </p>

            <br>
            <h2 class="text-left">Inhabitants</h2>
            <br>
            <p class="text-left">The first type of denizen encoutnered in the multiverse are naturally called <c>Primes</c>. <c>Primes</c> usually have their souls tethered to whatever plane they come from, and are rarely found outside their native territory. When they do step into the multiverse, they are often mocked as <c>Clueless</c>, though many have made the mistake of underestimating <c>Primes</c>: while some may be helpless saps who have stepped through the wrong portal, many are powerful creatrures or archmages who have left their <c>Material Plane<c> under their own power.</p>
            <br>
            <p class="text-left">Then come the <c>Outsiders</c>, creatures who are not so strongly bound to their plane of residence, merely anchored. Whenever a mage summons a creature to help him, it's likely that an <c>Outsider</c> will answer. <c>Ousiders</c> are a general classification for pretty much anything outside the <c>Prime Materials</c>, be they Elementals, lower Fiends and Devas, or <c>Primes</c> who have been away from their original plane for so long that they've lost their tether. Of course, more powerful <c>Outsiders</c> have means of protecting themselves from summoning.</p>
            <br>
            <p class="text-left"><c>Petitioners</c> are dead souls who have shuffled off the mortal coil, and have gone to the <c>Outer Plane</c> which best reflects their beliefs. Petitioners can never leave their respective <c>Outer Plane</c> without a change in status. They either merge with the plane itself, or become an <c>Outsider</c> denizen of that plane(demon, celestial etc).</p>
            <br>
            <p class="text-left">Governing the many Inner and Outer Planes are the <c>Powers</c>. There's a heated ongoing discussion amidst the paragon thaumaturgists whether the <c>Powers</c> are deities or not. In practice, there's little difference: they have more might in a single word than a mortal archmage will have in a lifetime. Their absolute servants are the <c>Proxies</c>, personally imbued with abilities by the particular <c>Power</c>.  </p>
            <br>
            <p class="text-left">Last but not least are the <c>Planars</c>. Given the infinte number of planes and the many powerful mages stemming from them, the rise of a planewalking elite was inevitable. Indeed, they have formed their own society, the <c>Imperium</c>. While technically <c>Outsiders</c>, the <c>Planars</c> have numerous protections against being summoned.</p>



            <br>
            <h2 class="text-left">Philosophy</h2>
            <br>
            <p class="text-left">Due to the infinite nature of the planes, it is hard to pin down specifics regading the functioning of the multiverse. Numerous questions remaing: Do <c>Outer Planes</c> exist due to the belief of mortals, or are they merely parasites who suddenly appeared and contaminated the mind of Primes, thus self-sustaining their existence? Are the <c>Elemental Planes</c> really the building blocks of matter in the <c>Prime Material</c> planes, or merely the end of the spectrum for worlds which are increasingly dominated by a specific element? Where does magic stem from? </p>
            <br>
            <p class="text-left">Whatever the case, some superstitions have risen which are used as rules of thumb by planeswalkers in order to get around:</p>
            <br>
            <ul>
              <li><c> Center of the Multiverse</c> - Naturally, every <c>Clueless</c> thinks their <c>Material Plane</c> is at the center of the multiverse. Those who have traversed it for a while know better: no place is more particularly important than the other. Still, some places are more useful than others, like <c>Sigil, the City of Doors</c>. Too bad the <c>Imperium</c> has been denied a foothold there by the <c>Lady of Pain</c>. </li>              
              <li><c>Unity of rings</c> - Rings have no beginning and end. Everything can be traced in circles. What goes around comes around. The <c>Material</c>, <c>Elemental</c>, and <c>Outer</c> Planes are all rings surrounding rings. This is the way of the multiverse. </li>
              <li><c>Rule of Threes</c> - In the multiverse, everything comes in threes; there are three cosmic truths (Center of the Multiverse,Unity of Rings, and Rule of Threes), three transitive planes (Astral, Ethereal, and Shadow) and three levels of existence (Outer Planes, Inner Planes, and Prime+Material). Between any two extremes  is a median that reconciles the other two</li>

            </ul>
